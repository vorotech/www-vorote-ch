# Top Open Source SIEM Tools in 2025

In today's complex digital landscape, security threats are increasingly sophisticated. Organizations need robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to detect, analyze, and respond to incidents effectively. While commercial platforms like Splunk or LogRhythm offer comprehensive features, their costs can be prohibitive, especially for small to medium-sized organizations.

Open source SIEM tools provide a compelling alternative. By 2025, these solutions have matured significantly, delivering powerful capabilities without the high price tag. This post explores the top open source SIEM tools available this year.

## What Makes a Good SIEM Solution?

A comprehensive SIEM solution should include:

* Log Collection: Gathering logs from diverse sources
* Data Normalization: Standardizing log formats for analysis
* Correlation: Identifying patterns across events
* Alerting: Notifying teams of suspicious activities
* Visualization: Providing dashboards for insights and reporting
* Threat Intelligence: Incorporating up-to-date threat data
* Compliance Support: Enabling regulatory reporting and controls

No single open source tool offers all these features out of the box, so organizations often combine multiple tools to build a complete SIEM stack.

## Top Open Source SIEM Tools in 2025
