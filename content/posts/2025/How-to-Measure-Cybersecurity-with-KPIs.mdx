excerpt: >
  You can’t improve what you don’t measure.


  Cybersecurity KPIs aren’t just a compliance checkbox — they’re the foundation
  for building resilience, driving accountability, and enabling continuous
  improvement. They help transform incident response from reactive firefighting
  into a measurable, managed function.


  Whether you're securing customer transactions, intellectual property, or
  operational uptime, metrics give you the visibility to make informed decisions
  and the leverage to justify investments.
