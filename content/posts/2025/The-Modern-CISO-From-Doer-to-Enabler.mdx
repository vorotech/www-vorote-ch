# The Modern CISO: From Doer to Enabler

Edward Roffe, a seasoned Global CISO and CIO, recently [shared](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edwardroffe_cybersecurity-leadership-ciso-activity-7328540637509619713-OnJf?utm_source=share\&utm_medium=member_desktop\&rcm=ACoAAAOdBIYBiCLnur515Fd7c5hyQ_ex1hfCQhg) a compelling perspective on LinkedIn about the evolving role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). He argues that the CISO’s focus is shifting from hands-on execution to strategic enablement.

  Your value now lies in being the enabler, shaper and unblocker.

This perspective highlights a broader transition in cybersecurity leadership, emphasizing empowerment and influence over direct action. This article explores this shift, outlines key metrics CISOs can teach their teams to measure success, and identifies where CISOs should direct their attention.

## The Shift to Strategic Leadership

Roffe’s central idea is that effective CISOs no longer secure systems themselves—they enable others to do so. This means stepping away from operational tasks and instead amplifying team capabilities, shaping security strategies, and aligning with business goals. The hard work of “clearing the path” for the team—securing budget, resources, and stakeholder support—is a critical part of this role. Some professionals note that CISOs must also unlearn the habit of firefighting, fostering a security-first culture while strategically accepting certain risks to support business objectives.

However, this shift isn’t without debate. During a major breach, some suggest CISOs may still need to highlight gaps in security posture, though others argue a well-prepared team and plan reduce the need for direct intervention—a stance Roffe supports. In some organizations, expectations linger that CISOs lead investigations, showing that this evolution varies by context.

## Metrics CISOs Can Enable

To succeed as enablers, CISOs must guide their teams to focus on meaningful outcomes rather than operational details. Here are key metrics they can instill:

### Team Empowerment

* **Percentage of Tasks Automated or Delegated**: Tracks how much operational work the team handles independently or through automation, reducing the CISO’s direct involvement.
* **Team Maturity Score**: A composite based on training, certifications, and ability to manage security controls, showing growth in capability.
* **Retention Rate**: Measures team satisfaction and stability, reflecting the CISO’s leadership effectiveness.

### Strategic Influence

* **Early Security Involvement in Projects**: Percentage of business projects where security is integrated from the start, demonstrating proactive influence.
* **Business Alignment Score**: Assesses how well security initiatives support organizational goals, such as customer trust or revenue growth.
* **Stakeholder Awareness**:  Evaluates executive and board understanding of security priorities, gauged through surveys or briefings.

### Risk and Incident Management

* **Open Risk Trends**: Monitors the number and severity of unresolved risks over time, reflecting the team’s risk management prowess.
* **Mean Time to Detect and Respond (MTTD/MTTR)**: Measures team efficiency in incident response, with the CISO overseeing rather than executing.
* **Lessons Learned Implementation**: Tracks improvements post-incident, ensuring the team drives continuous enhancement.

These metrics emphasize team performance and organizational security, aligning with the enabler role Roffe describes.

## Where CISOs Should Keep an Eye

As strategic leaders, CISOs must focus on key areas to guide their teams and align with business needs:

* **Emerging Threats**: Stay ahead of new risks, ensuring the team is prepared to adapt.
* **Regulatory Landscape**: Track changes in compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, SEC rules) to maintain adherence.
* **Technology Trends**: Leverage advancements like AI or automation to enhance security efficiency.
* **Team Development**: Ensure the team has the skills and resources to handle evolving challenges.
* **Business Priorities**: Align security efforts with organizational goals, reinforcing security’s strategic value.

## Balancing the Transition

While the enabler role is ideal, context matters. In smaller organizations or those with less mature security programs, CISOs may need to remain hands-on temporarily. An operational background helps CISOs understand team challenges, though the goal remains stepping back to lead strategically. Technical proficiency is valuable, but only when used to guide rather than micromanage.

## Conclusion

Edward Roffe’s vision of the CISO as an enabler rather than a doer reflects a pivotal shift in cybersecurity leadership. By empowering teams, shaping strategy, and focusing on metrics like team maturity, business alignment, and risk trends, CISOs can thrive in this role. Monitoring threats, regulations, and business needs keeps them impactful. While challenges persist in some settings, the modern CISO’s strength lies in building a capable team and leading from a strategic perspective.
