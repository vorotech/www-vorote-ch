In today's business environment, where cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and regulatory requirements are stricter than ever, effective Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) management is shifting from a competitive advantage to a fundamental necessity.

The consequences are a loss of visibility, exhausting manual labor, and increased risk.
