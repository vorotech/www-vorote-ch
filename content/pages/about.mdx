      # About Me


      Hi, I’m **Dmytro Vorotyntsev** — a security-minded engineer and strategist
      with over 16 years of experience in the IT industry, including more than 7
      years in DevSecOps roles. My journey has taken me through building secure
      infrastructure for consumer-scale platforms, leading security-centric
      engineering teams, and aligning technology with compliance and business
      goals.


      Throughout my career, I have successfully built and led a high-performing
      Platform and DevOps team, not only with a strong operational focus but
      also with an engineering-first mindset. By leveraging automation and
      modern tooling, our team was able to manage infrastructure at scale,
      reduce incident resolution times, and improve overall system reliability.
      We collaborated closely with development teams and executive leadership to
      ensure that incident handling, platform improvements, and business goals
      were aligned.


      In addition to establishing robust incident response protocols, I
      contributed to designing and implementing scalable, secure systems across
      multi-cloud environments. I led initiatives in DDoS protection, access
      control, and continuous compliance. I played a key role in completing
      successful ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 audits by working closely with CISOs
      and other stakeholders. At my previous role, I helped scale security
      practices for a crypto wallet platform serving over 100 million users
      globally.


      I currently lead a security engineering function focused on high-assurance
      environments. While I don't publicly share the specifics of this work, it
      significantly contributes to my ongoing growth in security leadership. One
      of my recent achievements includes successfully contributing to a
      NIST-based certification of an information system, where I received formal
      recognition for my key role in the engineering domain. This involved
      preparing and presenting detailed evidence of implemented security
      controls, as well as coordinating and delivering comprehensive supporting
      documentation required for the assessment.


      ## My Mission


      This blog is my platform to explore and share what it takes to evolve into
      a **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** — a path I’m deeply
      committed to.


      I believe the modern CISO should not only prepare for defense but also
      actively adopt **proactive and offensive practices** to uncover attack
      surfaces within their own infrastructure and throughout the supply chain.
      Leveraging **AI-driven solutions** to improve efficiency, decision-making,
      and threat detection is essential in this new era of cybersecurity.


      That’s why I write about:


      * Security strategy and leadership

      * Building resilient security programs

      * Risk metrics and meaningful KPIs

      * Incident response culture

      * Infrastructure security at scale

      * Developer-centric security enablement

      * Personal growth toward the CISO role

      Thanks for being here. I hope you find insights, tools, and ideas to help
      you build better, more secure systems — and maybe, like me, you're also on
      your own path to CISO.
