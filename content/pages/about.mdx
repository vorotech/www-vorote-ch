      # About Me

      I am **Dmytro Vorotyntsev** – a Cybersecurity Architect and strategist with over 18 years of experience in the IT industry. Since 2018, my career has been defined by the intersection of high-scale engineering and proactive security, building resilient infrastructure for global platforms and leading security-centric teams.

      I specialize in high-assurance environments where security is the primary business enabler. My approach combines an **engineering-first mindset with a strategic understanding of GRC**, driving a **Shift-Left** philosophy that integrates security and compliance directly into the development lifecycle. Whether scaling security for a crypto platform serving 100+ million users or navigating complex NIST-based certifications, I focus on transforming security from a final hurdle into a foundational architectural component.

      ## My Mission

      **Trust is the foundation.** While technology is the tool, I believe that trust – between teams, systems, and stakeholders – is what truly enables security at scale. My mission is to make the complex world of security **accessible and manageable for everyone**.
