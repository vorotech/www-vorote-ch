      # About Me

      I am **Dmytro Vorotyntsev** – a Cybersecurity Architect and strategist with over 18 years of experience in the IT industry. Since 2018, my career has been defined by the intersection of high-scale engineering and proactive security, building resilient infrastructure for global platforms and leading security-centric teams.

      I specialize in high-assurance environments where security is the primary business enabler. My approach combines an **engineering-first mindset with a strategic understanding of GRC**, driving a **Shift-Left** philosophy that integrates security and compliance directly into the development lifecycle. Whether scaling security for a crypto platform serving 100+ million users or navigating complex NIST-based certifications, I focus on transforming security from a final hurdle into a foundational architectural component.

      ## My Mission

      **Trust is the foundation.** While technology is the tool, I believe that trust — between teams, systems, and stakeholders — is what truly enables security at scale. My mission is to make the complex world of security **accessible and manageable for everyone**.

      This blog is my platform to share insights from my ongoing journey toward becoming a **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**. It's where I document what I'm learning, the challenges I'm tackling, and the evolving practices that shape modern security leadership.

      I'm particularly focused on:

      * **AI in Security** — exploring how AI can enhance threat detection, automate security operations, and improve decision-making
      * **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** — building frameworks that align security with business objectives and regulatory requirements
      * **Security strategy and leadership** — developing the mindset and skills needed for executive security roles
      * **Building resilient security programs** — creating sustainable, scalable security practices
      * **Infrastructure security at scale** — securing complex, multi-cloud environments
      * **Developer-centric security enablement** — making security a natural part of the development process

      Thanks for being here. I hope you find insights, tools, and ideas to help you build better, more secure systems — and maybe, like me, you're also on your own path to CISO.
